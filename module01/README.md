# 42_Python_Piscine

This is a **Python Bootcamp** developed by the [**42-AI team**](https://www.42ai.fr). This bootcamp is available to everyone who has access to the Internet. For this reason, instead of explaining the important concepts that I have covered during this bootcamp (which I usually do with all projects), I have decided to let you find them for yourself. This team has done a brilliant job creating this bootcamp, so if they haven't provided information on such concepts I'm not one to provide them.

**If you want to learn more about IT topics, visit my website:** [**IA Notes**](https://ia-notes.com/)

To access the Python Bootcamp go to the official [**42-AI repository**](https://github.com/42-AI/bootcamp_python). There you have all the information you need to get started. Good luck!
